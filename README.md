# OOP-Team-Generator

This program generates a website that displays a team. Run node app.js in the terminal in the correct directory and a page displaying user input will be created for any team. 

Technologies used: JavaScript and node.js

Challenges: This is the first project that I have built a program using test driven development.  Reading the tests and looking at the starter code at first was a challenge. After reviewing past class activities and using some google fu, I was able to create relevant classes for employee, manager, engineer, and intern and pass the 17 tests.  After this, thinking through the logic for how to create questions and define a function to display info in html and render a new file took some time and debugging. Overall, this was an enjoyable project that helped me understand node.js, inquirer, and test driven development better.
